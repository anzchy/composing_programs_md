    "\n",
    "We concentrated in Chapter 1 on computational processes and on the role of\n",
    "functions in program design. We saw how to use primitive data (numbers) and\n",
    "primitive operations (arithmetic), how to form compound functions through\n",
    "composition and control, and how to create functional abstractions by giving\n",
    "names to processes. We also saw that higher-order functions enhance the power\n",
    "of our language by enabling us to manipulate, and thereby to reason, in terms\n",
    "of general methods of computation. This is much of the essence of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on data. The techniques we investigate here will allow us\n",
    "to represent and manipulate information about many different domains. Due to\n",
    "the explosive growth of the Internet, a vast amount of structured information\n",
    "is freely available to all of us online, and computation can be applied to a\n",

    "As we consider the wide set of things in the world that we would like to\n",
    "represent in our programs, we find that most of them have compound structure.\n",
    "For example, a geographic position has latitude and longitude coordinates. To\n",
    "represent positions, we would like our programming language to have the\n",
    "capacity to couple together a latitude and longitude to form a pair, a\n",
    "_compound data_ value that our programs can manipulate as a single conceptual\n",
    "unit, but which also has two parts that can be considered individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of compound data enables us to increase the modularity of our\n",
    "programs. If we can manipulate geographic positions as whole values, then we\n",
    "can shield parts of our program that compute using positions from the details\n",
    "of how those positions are represented. The general technique of isolating the\n",
    "parts of a program that deal with how data are represented from the parts that\n",
    "deal with how data are manipulated is a powerful design methodology called\n",
    "_data abstraction_. Data abstraction makes programs much easier to design,\n",
    "maintain, and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction is similar in character to functional abstraction. When we\n",
    "create a functional abstraction, the details of how a function is implemented\n",
    "can be suppressed, and the particular function itself can be replaced by any\n",
    "other function with the same overall behavior. In other words, we can make an\n",
    "abstraction that separates the way the function is used from the details of\n",
    "how the function is implemented. Analogously, data abstraction isolates how a\n",
    "compound data value is used from the details of how it is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure programs so that they\n",
    "operate on abstract data. That is, our programs should use data in such a way\n",
    "as to make as few assumptions about the data as possible. At the same time, a\n",
    "concrete data representation is defined as an independent part of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two parts of a program, the part that operates on abstract data and the\n",
    "part that defines a concrete representation, are connected by a small set of\n",

    "We have seen how abstraction is vital in helping us to cope with the\n",
    "complexity of large systems. Effective programming also requires\n",
    "organizational principles that can guide us in formulating the overall design\n",
    "of a program. In particular, we need strategies to help us structure large\n",
    "systems to be modular, meaning that they divide naturally into coherent parts\n",
    "that can be separately developed and maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "One powerful technique for creating modular programs is to incorporate data\n",
    "that may change state over time. In this way, a single data object can\n",
    "represent something that evolves independently of the rest of the program. The\n",

    "itself out in text. If an object is composed of parts, it knows how to reveal\n",

    "\n",
    "Ever since we first encountered nested `def` statements, we have observed that\n",

    "up to you as a programmer to document your code clearly so that the effects of\n",
    "assignment can be understood by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Particulars.** This pattern of non-local assignment is a general\n",
    "feature of programming languages with higher-order functions and lexical\n",
    "scope. Most other languages do not require a `nonlocal` statement at all.\n",
    "Instead, non-local assignment is often the default behavior of assignment\n",
    "statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has an unusual restriction regarding the lookup of names: within\n",
    "the body of a function, all instances of a name must refer to the same frame.\n",
    "As a result, Python cannot look up the value of a name in a non-local frame,\n",
    "then bind that same name in the local frame, because the same name would be\n",
    "accessed in two different frames in the same function. This restriction allows\n",
    "Python to pre-compute which frame contains each name before executing the body\n",
    "of a function. When this restriction is violated, a confusing error message\n",
    "results. To demonstrate, the `make_withdraw` example is repeated below with\n",

    "implying that Python has considered line 5 in some way before executing line\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As we study interpreter design, we will see that pre-computing facts about\n",
    "   a function body before executing it is quite common. In this case, Python's\n",
    "   pre-processing restricted the frame in which `balance` could appear, and thus\n",
    "   prevented the name from being found. Adding a `nonlocal` statement corrects\n",
    "   this error. The `nonlocal` statement did not exist in Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.5 The Benefits of Non-Local Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-local assignment is an important step on our path to viewing a program as\n",
    "a collection of independent and autonomous _objects_ , which interact with\n",
    "each other but each manage their own internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, non-local assignment has given us the ability to maintain some\n",
    "state that is local to a function, but evolves over successive calls to that\n",
    "function. The `balance` associated with a particular withdraw function is\n",
    "shared among all calls to that function. However, the binding for balance\n",
    "associated with an instance of withdraw is inaccessible to the rest of the\n",
    "program. Only `wd` is associated with the frame for `make_withdraw` in which\n",
    "it was defined. If `make_withdraw` is called again, then it will create a\n",
    "separate frame with a separate binding for `balance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extend our example to illustrate this point. A second call to\n",
    "`make_withdraw` returns a second `withdraw` function that has a different\n",
    "parent. We bind this second function to the name `wd2` in the global frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "def make_withdraw(balance): def withdraw(amount): nonlocal balance if amount >\n",
    "balance: return 'Insufficient funds' balance = balance - amount return balance\n",
    "return withdraw wd = make_withdraw(20) wd2 = make_withdraw(7) wd2(6) wd(8)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we see that there are in fact two bindings for the name `balance` in two\n",
    "different frames, and each `withdraw` function has a different parent. The\n",
    "name `wd` is bound to a function with a balance of 20, while `wd2` is bound to\n",
    "a different function with a balance of 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling `wd2` changes the binding of its non-local `balance` name, but does\n",
    "not affect the function bound to the name `withdraw`. A future call to `wd` is\n",
    "unaffected by the changing balance of `wd2`; its balance is still 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "def make_withdraw(balance): def withdraw(amount): nonlocal balance if amount >\n",
    "balance: return 'Insufficient funds' balance = balance - amount return balance\n",
    "return withdraw wd = make_withdraw(20) wd2 = make_withdraw(7) wd2(6) wd(8)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, each instance of `withdraw` maintains its own balance state, but\n",
    "that state is inaccessible to any other function in the program. Viewing this\n",
    "situation at a higher level, we have created an abstraction of a bank account\n",
    "that manages its own internals but behaves in a way that models accounts in\n",

    "are bound to the same function or different instances of that function.\n",
    "Consider the following example, which contrasts the one we just analyzed. In\n",

    "to those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to correctly analyzing code with non-local assignment is to remember\n",
    "that only function calls can introduce new frames. Assignment statements\n",

    "`make_withdraw` is called twice, there can be only one binding for `balance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sameness and change.** These subtleties arise because, by introducing non-\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, so long as we never modify data objects, we can regard a compound\n",
    "data object to be precisely the totality of its pieces. For example, a\n",
    "rational number is determined by giving its numerator and its denominator. But\n",
    "this view is no longer valid in the presence of change, where a compound data\n",
    "object has an \"identity\" that is something different from the pieces of which\n",

    "program execution. Moreover, using functions with local state, we are able to\n",
    "implement mutable data types. In fact, we can implement abstract data types\n",
    "that are equivalent to the built-in `list` and `dict` types introduced above.\n",

    "particular, we cannot use `None` to represent an empty mutable list, because\n",
    "two empty lists are not identical values (e.g., appending to one does not\n",
    "append to the other), but `None is None`. On the other hand, two different\n",
    "functions that each have `empty` as their local state will suffice to\n",
    "distinguish two empty lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a mutable linked list is a function, what arguments does it take? The\n",
    "answer exhibits a general pattern in programming: the function is a dispatch\n",

    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method for organizing programs that\n",
    "brings together many of the ideas introduced in this chapter. Like the\n",
    "functions in data abstraction, classes create abstraction barriers between the\n",
    "use and implementation of data. Like dispatch dictionaries, objects respond to\n",
    "behavioral requests. Like mutable data structures, objects have local state\n",
    "that is not directly accessible from the global environment. The Python object\n",
    "system provides convenient syntax to promote the use of these techniques for\n",
    "organizing programs. Much of this syntax is shared among other object-oriented\n",
    "programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object system offers more than just convenience. It enables a new metaphor\n",
    "for designing programs in which several independent agents interact within the\n",
    "computer. Each object bundles together local state and behavior in a way that\n",
    "abstracts the complexity of both. Objects communicate with each other, and\n",
    "useful results are computed as a consequence of their interaction. Not only do\n",
    "objects pass messages, they also share behavior among other objects of the\n",
    "same type and inherit characteristics from related types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paradigm of object-oriented programming has its own vocabulary that\n",
    "supports the object metaphor. We have seen that an object is a data value that\n",
    "has methods and attributes, accessible via dot notation. Every object also has\n",
    "a type, called its _class_. To create new types of data, we implement new\n",
    "classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5.1 Objects and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A class serves as a template for all objects whose type is that class. Every\n",
    "object is an instance of some particular class. The objects we have used so\n",
    "far all have built-in classes, but new user-defined classes can be created as\n",
    "well. A class definition specifies the attributes and methods shared among\n",
    "objects of that class. We will introduce the class statement by revisiting the\n",
    "example of a bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "When introducing local state, we saw that bank accounts are naturally modeled\n",
    "as mutable values that have a `balance`. A bank account object should have a\n",
    "`withdraw` method that updates the account balance and returns the requested\n",
    "amount, if it is available. To complete the abstraction: a bank account should\n",
    "be able to return its current `balance`, return the name of the account\n",
    "`holder`, and an amount for `deposit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `Account` class allows us to create multiple instances of bank accounts.\n",
    "The act of creating a new object instance is known as _instantiating_ the\n",
    "class. The syntax in Python for instantiating a class is identical to the\n",
    "syntax of calling a function. In this case, we call `Account` with the\n",
    "argument `'Kirk'`, the account holder's name.\n",

    "## 2.6 Implementing Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in the object-oriented programming paradigm, we use the object\n",
    "metaphor to guide the organization of our programs. Most logic about how to\n",
    "represent and manipulate data is expressed within class declarations. In this\n",
    "section, we see that classes and objects can themselves be represented using\n",
    "just functions and dictionaries. The purpose of implementing an object system\n",
    "in this way is to illustrate that using the object metaphor does not require a\n",
    "special programming language. Programs can be object-oriented, even in\n",
    "programming languages that do not have a built-in object system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement objects, we will abandon dot notation (which does\n",
    "require built-in language support), but create dispatch dictionaries that\n",
    "behave in much the same way as the elements of the built-in object system. We\n",
    "have already seen how to implement message-passing behavior through dispatch\n",
    "dictionaries. To implement an object system in full, we send messages between\n",
    "instances, classes, and base classes, all of which are dictionaries that\n",
    "contain attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not implement the entire Python object system, which includes features\n",
    "that we have not covered in this text (e.g., meta-classes and static methods).\n",
    "We will focus instead on user-defined classes without multiple inheritance and\n",
    "without introspective behavior (such as returning the class of an instance).\n",
    "Our implementation is not meant to follow the precise specification of the\n",
    "Python type system. Instead, it is designed to implement the core\n",
    "functionality that enables the object metaphor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6.1 Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with instances. An instance has named attributes, such as the balance\n",
    "of an account, which can be set and retrieved. We implement an instance using\n",
    "a dispatch dictionary that responds to messages that \"get\" and \"set\" attribute\n",
    "values. Attributes themselves are stored in a local dictionary called\n",
    "`attributes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen previously in this chapter, dictionaries themselves are\n",
    "abstract data types. We implemented dictionaries with lists, we implemented\n",

    "object system in terms of dictionaries, keep in mind that we could just as\n",
    "well be implementing objects using functions alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin our implementation, we assume that we have a class implementation\n",

    "either representation. We implement such a system below. As a side note, we\n",
