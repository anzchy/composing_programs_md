    "# Chapter 3: Interpreting Computer Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapters 1 and 2 describe the close connection between two fundamental\n",
    "elements of programming: functions and data. We saw how functions can be\n",
    "manipulated as data using higher-order functions. We also saw how data can be\n",
    "endowed with behavior using message passing and an object system. We have also\n",
    "studied techniques for organizing large programs, such as functional\n",
    "abstraction, data abstraction, class inheritance, and generic functions. These\n",
    "core concepts constitute a strong foundation upon which to build modular,\n",
    "maintainable, and extensible programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on the third fundamental element of programming: programs\n",
    "themselves. A Python program is just a collection of text. Only through the\n",
    "process of interpretation do we perform any meaningful computation based on\n",
    "that text. A programming language like Python is useful because we can define\n",
    "an _interpreter_ , a program that carries out Python's evaluation and\n",
    "execution procedures. It is no exaggeration to regard this as the most\n",
    "fundamental idea in programming, that an interpreter, which determines the\n",
    "meaning of expressions in a programming language, is just another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To appreciate this point is to change our images of ourselves as programmers.\n",
    "We come to see ourselves as designers of languages, rather than only users of\n",
    "languages designed by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages vary widely in their syntactic structures, features, and\n",
    "domain of application. Among general purpose programming languages, the\n",
    "constructs of function definition and function application are pervasive. On\n",
    "the other hand, powerful languages exist that do not include an object system,\n",
    "higher-order functions, assignment, or even control constructs such as `while`\n",
    "and `for` statements. As an example of a powerful language with a minimal set\n",
    "of features, we will introduce the\n",
    "[Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_\\(programming_language\\))\n",
    "programming language. The subset of Scheme introduced in this text does not\n",
    "allow mutable values at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we study the design of interpreters and the computational\n",
    "processes that they create when executing programs. The prospect of designing\n",
    "an interpreter for a general programming language may seem daunting. After\n",
    "all, interpreters are programs that can carry out any possible computation,\n",
    "depending on their input. However, many interpreters have an elegant common\n",
    "structure: two mutually recursive functions. The first evaluates expressions\n",
    "in environments; the second applies functions to arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions are recursive in that they are defined in terms of each other:\n",
    "applying a function requires evaluating the expressions in its body, while\n",
    "evaluating an expression may involve applying one or more functions.\n",

    "## 3.2 Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The software running on any modern computer is written in a variety of\n",
    "programming languages. There are physical languages, such as the machine\n",
    "languages for particular computers. These languages are concerned with the\n",
    "representation of data and control in terms of individual bits of storage and\n",
    "primitive machine instructions. The machine-language programmer is concerned\n",
    "with using the given hardware to erect systems and utilities for the efficient\n",
    "implementation of resource-limited computations. High-level languages, erected\n",
    "on a machine-language substrate, hide concerns about the representation of\n",
    "data as collections of bits and the representation of programs as sequences of\n",
    "primitive instructions. These languages have means of combination and\n",
    "abstraction, such as function definition, that are appropriate to the larger-\n",
    "scale organization of software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduce a high-level programming language that\n",
    "encourages a functional style. Our object of study, a subset of the Scheme\n",
    "language, employs a very similar model of computation to Python's, but uses\n",
    "only expressions (no statements), specializes in symbolic computation, and\n",
    "employs only immutable values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scheme is a dialect of\n",
    "[Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_\\(programming_language\\)), the\n",
    "second-oldest programming language that is still widely used today (after\n",
    "[Fortran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)). The community of Lisp\n",
    "programmers has continued to thrive for decades, and new dialects of Lisp such\n",
