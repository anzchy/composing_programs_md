    "# Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer science is a tremendously broad academic discipline. The areas of\n",
    "globally distributed systems, artificial intelligence, robotics, graphics,\n",
    "security, scientific computing, computer architecture, and dozens of emerging\n",
    "sub-fields all expand with new techniques and discoveries every year. The\n",
    "rapid progress of computer science has left few aspects of human life\n",
    "unaffected. Commerce, communication, science, art, leisure, and politics have\n",
    "all been reinvented as computational domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high productivity of computer science is only possible because the\n",
    "discipline is built upon an elegant and powerful set of fundamental ideas. All\n",
    "computing begins with representing information, specifying logic to process\n",
    "it, and designing abstractions that manage the complexity of that logic.\n",
    "Mastering these fundamentals will require us to understand precisely how\n",
    "computers interpret computer programs and carry out computational processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These fundamental ideas have long been taught using the classic textbook\n",

    "\n",
    "> A language isn't something you learn so much as something you join.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> [Arika Okrent](http://arikaokrent.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define computational processes, we need a programming language;\n",
    "preferably one that many humans and a great variety of computers can all\n",
    "understand. In this text, we will work primarily with the\n",
    "[Python](http://docs.python.org/py3k/) language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a widely used programming language that has recruited enthusiasts\n",
    "from many professions: web programmers, game engineers, scientists, academics,\n",
    "and even designers of new programming languages. When you learn Python, you\n",
    "join a million-person-strong community of developers. Developer communities\n",
    "are tremendously important institutions: members help each other solve\n",
    "problems, share their projects and experiences, and collectively develop\n",
    "software and tools. Dedicated members often achieve celebrity and widespread\n",
    "esteem for their contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language itself is the product of a [large volunteer\n",
    "community](http://www.python.org/psf/members/) that prides itself on the\n",
    "[diversity](http://python.org/community/diversity/) of its contributors. The\n",
    "language was conceived and first implemented by [Guido van\n",
    "Rossum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in the late 1980's. The\n",
    "first chapter of his [Python 3\n",
    "Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/appetite.html) explains why\n",
    "Python is so popular, among the many languages available today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python excels as an instructional language because, throughout its history,\n",
    "Python's developers have emphasized the human interpretability of Python code,\n",
    "reinforced by the [Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)\n",
    "guiding principles of beauty, simplicity, and readability. Python is\n",
    "particularly appropriate for this text because its broad set of features\n",
    "support a variety of different programming styles, which we will explore.\n",
    "While there is no single way to program in Python, there are a set of\n",
    "conventions shared across the developer community that facilitate reading,\n",
    "understanding, and extending existing programs. Python's combination of great\n",
    "flexibility and accessibility allows students to explore many programming\n",
    "paradigms, and then apply their newly acquired knowledge to thousands of\n",
    "[ongoing projects](http://pypi.python.org/pypi).\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes maintain the spirit of [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp) by\n",
    "introducing the features of Python in step with techniques for abstraction and\n",
    "a rigorous model of computation. In addition, these notes provide a practical\n",
    "introduction to Python programming, including some advanced language features\n",
    "and illustrative examples. Increasing your facility with Python should come\n",
    "naturally as you progress through the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to get started programming in Python is to interact with the\n",
    "interpreter directly. This section describes how to install Python 3, initiate\n",
    "an interactive session with the interpreter, and start programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Installing Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all great software, Python has many versions. This text will use the\n",
    "most recent stable version of Python 3. Many computers have older versions of\n",
    "Python installed already, such as Python 2.7, but those will not match the\n",
    "descriptions in this text. You should be able to use any computer, but expect\n",
    "to install Python 3. (Don't worry, Python is free.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download Python 3 from the Python downloads page by clicking on the\n",
    "version that begins with 3 (not 2). Follow the instructions of the installer\n",
    "to complete installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further guidance, try these video tutorials on [Windows\n",
    "installation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54-wuFsPi0w) and [Mac\n",
    "installation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smHuBHxJdK8) of Python 3, created\n",
    "by Julia Oh.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Interactive Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "In an interactive Python session, you type some Python _code_ after the\n",
    "_prompt_ , `>>>`. The Python _interpreter_ reads and executes what you type,\n",
    "carrying out your various commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start an interactive session, run the Python 3 application. Type `python3`\n",
    "at a terminal prompt (Mac/Unix/Linux) or open the Python 3 application in\n",
    "Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see the Python prompt, `>>>`, then you have successfully started an\n",
    "interactive session. These notes depict example interactions using the prompt,\n",
    "followed by some input.\n",

    "A programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to\n",

    "organize our ideas about computational processes. Programs serve to\n",
    "communicate those ideas among the members of a programming community. Thus,\n",
    "programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for\n",

    "\n",
    "When we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means\n",
    "that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex\n",
    "ideas. Every powerful language has three such mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **primitive expressions and statements** , which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,\n",
    "  * **means of combination** , by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and\n",
    "  * **means of abstraction** , by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: functions and data. (Soon\n",
    "we will discover that they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is\n",
    "stuff that we want to manipulate, and functions describe the rules for\n",
    "manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be able\n",

    "Functions are an essential ingredient of all programs, large and small, and\n",
    "serve as our primary medium to express computational processes in a\n",
    "programming language. So far, we have discussed the formal properties of\n",
    "functions and how they are applied. We now turn to the topic of what makes a\n",
    "good function. Fundamentally, the qualities of good functions all reinforce\n",
    "the idea that functions are abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Each function should have exactly one job. That job should be identifiable with a short name and characterizable in a single line of text. Functions that perform multiple jobs in sequence should be divided into multiple functions.\n",
    "  * _Don't repeat yourself_ is a central tenet of software engineering. The so-called DRY principle states that multiple fragments of code should not describe redundant logic. Instead, that logic should be implemented once, given a name, and applied multiple times. If you find yourself copying and pasting a block of code, you have probably found an opportunity for functional abstraction.\n",
    "  * Functions should be defined generally. Squaring is not in the Python Library precisely because it is a special case of the `pow` function, which raises numbers to arbitrary powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These guidelines improve the readability of code, reduce the number of errors,\n",
    "and often minimize the total amount of code written. Decomposing a complex\n",
