    "query language in use today is called Structured Query Language or SQL\n",

    "\n",
    "SQL is an example of a declarative programming language. Statements do not\n",
    "describe computations directly, but instead describe the desired result of\n",

    "synchronization, over-synchronizing, or causing the program to hang as a\n",
    "result of deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Under-synchronization**. A common pitfall in parallel computing is to\n",
    "neglect to properly synchronize shared accesses. In the set example, we need\n",
    "to synchronize the membership check and insertion together, so that another\n",
    "thread cannot perform an insertion in between these two operations. Failing to\n",
    "synchronize the two operations together is erroneous, even if they are\n",
    "separately synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Over-synchronization**. Another common error is to over-synchronize a\n",
    "program, so that non-conflicting operations cannot occur concurrently. As a\n",
    "trivial example, we can avoid all conflicting access to shared data by\n",
    "acquiring a master lock when a thread starts and only releasing it when a\n",
    "thread completes. This serializes our entire code, so that nothing runs in\n",
    "parallel. In some cases, this can even cause our program to hang indefinitely.\n",
    "For example, consider a consumer/producer program in which the consumer\n",
    "obtains the lock and never releases it. This prevents the producer from\n",
    "producing any items, which in turn prevents the consumer from doing anything\n",
    "since it has nothing to consume.\n",

    "synchronization mechanisms are vulnerable to _deadlock_ , a situation in which\n",
    "two or more threads or processes are stuck, waiting for each other to finish.\n",
